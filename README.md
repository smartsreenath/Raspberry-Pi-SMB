### What is NAS ?

Network-attached storage (NAS) allows you to save files from your computer and mobile devices to external hard drives via your home or office wireless network.
There are plenty of ready-built NAS devices out there, from companies such as Synology, QNAP, and Asustor. But they can get expensive.
The Raspberry Pi, on the other hand, is such a versatile little board that it can act as a cheap NAS.
### Choosing the right Raspberry Pi and accessories
The faster your Raspberry Pi, the faster your data will save to your external storage. For this reason, I recommend using a Raspberry Pi 4 with atleast 2gb RAM.

### Even though you have perefectly running OS installed in Raspberyy pi, I recommend you go through below tutorials
